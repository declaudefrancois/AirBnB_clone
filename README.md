# AirBnB clone

The goal of this project, divided into several parts, is to create a simple clone of the original [Airbnb website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

The final app will be composed of :

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

# I - AirbnB - The console

In this first step, we create a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
